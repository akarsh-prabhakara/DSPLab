# DSP Lab
This repo consists of my work in the DSP Lab, NITK - Jan 2016

DTMF - A Matlab script to generate and play appropriate dial tones for each digit as one would hear on a landline / mobile phone.

Music Synthesis - An attempt to generate computer music similar to that played on an instrument such as keyboard. The user can supply a set of notes (in Indian music style) as input and listen to the generated music. The algorithm takes into account the effect of higher harmonics and smoothing between notes.
